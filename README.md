# Core Java Project README

## 📋 Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive demonstration of core Java programming skills, encompassing fundamental concepts such as object-oriented programming, exception handling, and graphical user interface (GUI) design. The project includes two main applications:

1. **🧮 Calculator**: A simple desktop application that performs basic arithmetic operations.
2. **❌⭕ Tic Tac Toe**: A desktop game application that allows two players to play the classic Tic Tac Toe game.

## ✨ Features

### 🧮 Calculator
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Clear and backspace functionality.
- Error handling for invalid operations (e.g., division by zero).

### ❌⭕ Tic Tac Toe
- 3x3 grid for game play.
- Two-player mode (Player X and Player O).
- Win detection for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines.
- Reset functionality to start a new game.

## 🛠 Technologies and Concepts Used

### ☕ Core Java
- **Java SE**: Standard Edition of Java used for building the applications.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism are applied throughout the project.
- **Exception Handling**: Try-catch blocks are used to handle runtime exceptions, ensuring robustness.

### 🖼 Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- **Swing**: Java's built-in GUI widget toolkit used for creating windows, buttons, text fields, and other components.
- **Event Handling**: Action listeners and event listeners are implemented to handle user interactions with the GUI.

### 📁 Project Structure
- **src/**: Contains all Java source files.
  - **calculator/**: Contains the Calculator application source files.
  - **tictactoe/**: Contains the Tic Tac Toe game source files.
- **bin/**: Contains compiled Java class files.

## 💻 Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans is recommended for easy project setup and execution.
