Event handling
==============
Event means occurrence
Performing any operation can be treated as event

1)Create listener class
2)Give object of listener class to the source(such as button,frame,label,etc)



public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt)
This method is declared inside ActionListener interface and code to call this method is written inside click event of JButton class
We will have to provide implementation(body) of this method

class Task implements ActionListener
{
  public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt)
  {
	//command
  }
}
In event handling programming, this class is known as event listener class.Methods overridden inside this interface are known as event handlers
